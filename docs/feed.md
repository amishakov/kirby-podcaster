# Feed

To use Kirbys UUIDs as GUID in the feed, set this option in your config:

`'mauricerenck.podcaster.feed.uuid' => true`

default is false for backwarts compatibility 

changing this on a published podcast may result in duplicated episodes in Apple Podcasts as the GUID value should always be unique
